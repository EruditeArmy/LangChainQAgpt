#This is a model where you can ask GPT-4 a question and it will make a reply. There is also a txt file where you can input data/info. This txt is also used when GPT-4 makes a response. 
#For example you can put in a article and you can ask GPT-4 to paraphrase it and you will get a paraphrased response.
#You will need an OPENAI API Key which can access GPT-4 to use. There are more instructions in the code itself on how to use it.
